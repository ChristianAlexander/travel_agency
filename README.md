To start your Phoenix server:

* Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to an Anthropic API key
  * With a little effort, this can also work with OpenAI. Just change `Anthropic` to `OpenAI` in a few places!
* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/chat`](http://localhost:4000/chat) from your browser.
